Web Worker Manager - a manager to create and oversee web workers

Web Worker Manager is a small component that manages the creation of inline web workers with respect to what a given browser on a device can handle. It also monitors each web worker, reusing workers as needed or terminating them when they are idle and no longer needed.

#### Browser Support


#### Dependencies

wwmanager has been tested on jQuery 3.3.1 but should work with jQuery 2.1 and 1.7
